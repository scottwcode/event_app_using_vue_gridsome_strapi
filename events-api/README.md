<!-- Available commands in your project to start a local server:

  <!-- 
Once the above server is running. The Strapi CMS to 
create collections and add data can be accessed from
http://localhost:1337/admin/

There will need to be 2 collection types created (Event and Category) to 
contain the fields needed for this project (as listed as attributes
in the models/*.settings.json files). These collections will
then need to be populated with data. Both of these actions can be 
done through the Strapi CMS.
